## Project Overview

This project is a voice-driven application that combines cutting-edge technologies to deliver an interactive and seamless conversational experience. It leverages speech recognition, natural language processing, real-time communication, and speech synthesis to create a fully functional voice assistant. Below is an in-depth breakdown of the key components:

### Key Features

1. **Speech Recognition**  
    The application listens to the user's voice input and converts it into text using Speech Recognition Web APIs recently added to newer versions of the browsers. This enables hands-free interaction and makes the application accessible to a wide range of users.

2. **OpenAI API Integration**  
    Once the user's speech is transcribed into text, it is sent to OpenAI's API. The API processes the input and generates a meaningful, context-aware response. This allows the application to provide intelligent and dynamic replies.

3. **Socket.io Communication**  
    Real-time communication between the client and server is achieved using Socket.io. This ensures low-latency interactions, making the application responsive and efficient.

4. **Speech Synthesis**  
    The response generated by OpenAI's API is converted into speech using text-to-speech (TTS) technology provided by the Speech Synthesis Web API. This enables the application to "speak" back to the user, completing the conversational loop.

### Use Cases

This project can be adapted for various applications, including but not limited to:
- **Virtual Assistants**: Enhance productivity by automating tasks and providing quick answers.
- **Customer Support**: Offer real-time assistance to customers with natural, human-like interactions.
- **Accessibility Tools**: Empower users with disabilities by providing a voice-driven interface.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Real-Time Communication**: Socket.io
- **APIs**: OpenAI API for natural language processing, Speech Recognition Web API and Speech Synthesis Web API

### Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eshaansinghparihar/push-to-talk.git
    cd push-to-talk
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
    - Create a `.env` file in the server directory.
    - Add your OpenAI API key and gpt model configurations:
      ```
      OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
      OPENAI_MODEL=your_favourite_model
      ```

4. Start the server:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm run start
    cd server
    npm run start
    ```

5. Open the application in your browser:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

### How It Works

1. The user speaks into their microphone.
2. The application captures the audio and converts it into text using speech recognition.
3. The transcribed text is sent to the server via Socket.io.
4. The server forwards the text to OpenAI's API and receives a response.
5. The response is sent back to the client in real-time.
6. The client converts the text response into speech and plays it back to the user.
7. The context of the conversation is stored for further communication.
